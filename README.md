Chapter 1 Introduction

1.1	Introduction

Currency converter (or currency exchange) is a mini project coded in Java programming language. This simple application provides a J-Frame interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency (say $) to another currency (say €).
    
1.2	Design Goals/Objective

In this project, we will learn to implement a Currency converter using java. Different countries use different currency, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.


Such application can be used by any user, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis. In this currency converter app, users are provided with an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter amount to be converted (say currency in Dollars), and display the converted amount (say currency in Euro).

3.2	Discussions

3.2.1	Achievements

A currency converter is useful if you are traveling between different countries that have different types of currencies. I can determine how many euros I can get for my US dollar when I arrive. Also if I’m buying food at a restaurant I can tell what my food is costing in US dollars which is what I’m used to. That way I can see if it’s a true value or not based on my known reference point

3.2.2	Bugs

We are currently preparing a patch for this issue for our 4.4 and later systems.  Once the patch has been created it will be available to all customers with an active support contract.  Additional details will be sent out via our support and sales team once our patch is available for download.
Chapter 4 Conclusion
4.1	Introduction

The project involves a good knowledge of java programming language. This project is very affordable and useful for the people who are in business, shares or finance. The project will require a good knowledge over the template form of java and its programming. As it is a web-based program, it will update automatically.

4.1	Practical Implications

A universal currency converter is a software application or website that provides for the easy conversion of currency values based on present-day exchange rates. Such currency converters can easily be found for free on the Internet, and can quickly convert the value of one currency to another, such as dollars to euros, or euros to pounds, and back again.
4.2	Scope of Future Work

Currency conversion is of practical use to tourists who travel abroad, to businesses who do business overseas or are involved in imports and exports, and to FX traders.
•	A universal currency converter is an app or web tool that allows for the quick conversion of any currency into any other currency.
•	Universal converters typically use the most recent market prices in the foreign exchange market.
•	Currency converters are use useful to tourists, multi-national businesses, and forex traders.
